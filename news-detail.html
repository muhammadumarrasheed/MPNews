                <p>The arrest of Imran Khan, the former Prime Minister of Pakistan, sent shockwaves through the country on May 9, 2023. Khan, who led the ruling party for several years, was taken into custody by federal authorities amid corruption allegations.</p>
                <img src="./public/image-1@2x.png" alt="Imran Khan Arrest" class="article-image">
                <p>The arrest followed a lengthy investigation conducted by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), which was looking into potential financial irregularities and misuse of authority during Khan's tenure as Prime Minister. The NAB reportedly
                    gathered substantial evidence to support their claims.</p>
                <p>The news of Imran Khan's arrest sparked immediate political turmoil, with his supporters rallying in protest and demanding his release. Opposition parties seized the opportunity to criticize Khan's government and called for a thorough
                    investigation into the corruption allegations.</p>
                <p>Government officials, on the other hand, defended the arrest, stating that it was a necessary step towards ensuring transparency and accountability in the country. They emphasized that the legal process would be followed diligently, and
                    Khan would have the opportunity to present his defense in court.</p>
                <p>As news of the arrest spread, international media outlets also covered the story, raising concerns about the stability of Pakistan's political landscape and the impact on its relations with other countries.</p>
                <p>The arrest of a prominent political figure like Imran Khan undoubtedly marks a significant moment in Pakistan's political history. The coming days are likely to witness further developments, including legal proceedings, political reactions,
                    and potential shifts in the country's power dynamics.</p>
                <p>It remains to be seen how this arrest will shape the future of Imran Khan's political career and the political landscape of Pakistan as a whole. The nation awaits the unfolding events with great anticipation and anxiety.</p>
